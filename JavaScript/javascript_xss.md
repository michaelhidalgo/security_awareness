# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Description

XSS attacks are one of the most prevalent security flaws and mainly they occur when an application includes user-supplied data that is sent to the browser without proper input data validation or sanitization.

There are three types of XSS flaws:
* Stored
* Reflected
* DOM-based XSS attacks

For a deep understanding on the risks associated to XSS from JavaScript, please refer to [[Security] OWASP Top 10 for JavaScript - A2: Cross-Site Scripting - XSS](https://erlend.oftedal.no/blog/static-127.html).


# Code examples

Let's assume that we have a Web application that writes down in a div, the data that came from a text form or dropdown list that the user selected:

```html
<div class="data"/>
````

Here is the JavaScript code:

```JavaScript
var input = $("txtCommend").val();
$('.data').html(input);

// If the user sends this payload:
// '<script>alert("XSS");</script\>'
// It will evaluate the this code, 

```

# Mitigation

If JQuery is being used, an effective way is to use the function [text()](https://api.jquery.com/text/#text2):

``` JavaScript
// Having a div as follows:
//<div class="message"> some text goes here </div>

var userData = "<script>alert('xss');</script>";

$("div.message").text(userData);
// it produces:
// <div class="message">&lt;script&gt;alert('xss');&lt;/script&gt;</div>

// getting the text as string
var escapedString = $("<div>").text(userData).html();
// output: 
// &lt;script&gt;alert('xss');&lt;/script&gt;
```

Additionally, folks from [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) implemented the following code to perform [HTML escaping](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/blob/master/mustache.js#L78) and remediate this issue, the code can be found at their github repository and goes like this:

```JavaScript

var entityMap = {
    '&': '&amp;',
    '<': '&lt;',
    '>': '&gt;',
    '"': '&quot;',
    "'": '&#39;',
    '/': '&#x2F;',
    '`': '&#x60;',
    '=': '&#x3D;'
  };

  function escapeHtml (string) {
    return String(string).replace(/[&<>"'`=\/]/g, function fromEntityMap (s) {
      return entityMap[s];
    });
  }

```

It is strongly recommended to use a security-focused encoding library. For example, for JavaScript serialization to JSON, it is recommended to use  [Yahoo's Serialize JavaScript](https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript) because it provides an automatic escaping HTML Characters.

## Risk Assessment

Cross-Site Scripting is considered moderate to severe vulnerabilities. The most severe type of XSS is stored ith remote code execution on the victimâ€™s browser, such as stealing credentials, sessions, or delivering malware to the victim.
